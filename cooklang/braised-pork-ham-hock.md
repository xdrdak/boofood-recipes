-- Recipe for Braised Pork Ham Hock

[- Required equipment: Large pot -]

[- Spice Pouch -]
Wrap @star anise{3}, @cloves{10}, @cinnamon stick{2%g}, @sichuan peppercorns{1%g}, @fennel seeds{3%g}, @black cardamom pods{2 whole}, @bay leaf{5}, @dried orange peel{5%g}, @black or white peppercorns{4%g} in a cheesecloth and tie securely with a kitchen string.

Rinse the @pork{3 pounds ham hock}.

Place the pork in a large pot with @ginger{2%tbsp, thickly sliced} and @Chinese cooking wine{2%tbsp}, and fill the pot with enough #water{} to just cover the pork.

Cover and bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute.

Turn off the heat.

Drain pork and ginger slices.

Wash the pork and remove as many bristles on the skin as possible, use tweezers if necessary.

Heat the large pot with @oil{3%tbsp} over medium heat. Brown the ham hock until all the sides of the skin is lightly crisp and brown (Takes about 10-15 minutes). Use a spoon to scoop the oil to facilitate this process.

Remove the ham hock from the pot and let it rest.

Reduce the heat to low, add @brown sugar{40%g} to the remaining oil.

Once the sugar has dissolved, add @ginger{5 slices}, @garlic{5 cloves}, and scallion whites and heat until aromatic.

Add @Chinese cooking wine{1/2%cup}, @light soy sauce{1/4%cup}, @dark soy sauce{1%tbsp}, and #water{} and bring to a boil.

Add the ham hock and secure the spice pouch. Ensure the ham hock is fully submerged, otherwise add more water.

Cover the pot and bring to a boil.

Cook the ham hock for 3 hours with the lid on, flipping it every half hour to ensure it is evenly cooked.

Once the ham hock falls apart, transfer the ham hock into the serving plate.

Add the corn starch slurry (@corn starch + @water{1%tbsp} mix) to make a thin gravy.

Adjust the sauce to taste.

Add @sesame oil{1/4%tsp} before serving (optional).
