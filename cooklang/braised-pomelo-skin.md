-- Recipe for Braised Pomelo Skin

Remove the outer shell of the @pomelo{1 whole}, leaving only the pith. Eat the flesh.

Submerge in water, squeeze out, and repeat until the water runs clear.

Boil the skin in some water for 2.5 minutes.

Squeeze and rinse the skin again.

Squeeze out as much water as possible from the skin without damaging them.

In a pot, add @pork fat{1%tbsp} and melt properly.

Add the pomelo skin and mix well.

Add @cooking wine{3%tbsp} and ensure the wine bubbles.

Add @broth{1%L} (ideally shrimp broth).

Add @soy sauce{3%tbsp}, @sugar{1%tsp} [-optional-], and @white pepper{1%tbsp}.

Adjust for MSG or chicken bouillon (make sure that at this point, it's less salty than you want).

Bring mixture to a boil and add @corn starch + @water mix{3%tbsp} to thicken the sauce.

Adjust for salt and seasoning.

[- Notes:
-- If you leave out the boiling part, you'll end up having a bitter dish.
