-- Recipe for Chili Oil

[- Required equipment: Saucepan, Heat-proof bowl -]

In a heat-proof bowl with lots of room to spare, combine:
@chili flakes{40%g},
@salt{0.25%tsp},
@sugar{0.5%tsp},
@white pepper{0.5%tsp},
@paprika{1%tbsp} (optional, only for color),
@peanuts{1%handful} (optional).

Heat @canola oil{2%cups} in a saucepan until it hits 300F (enough to bubble around a spare piece of onion).

Turn the heat lower and add:
@ginger{15 g, chunked},
@garlic{3 cloves, smashed},
@shallots{30 g, halved},
@onion{30 g, halved},
@star anise{2 whole}, one at a time, until all ingredients develop a brown hue.

Stir to prevent burning and for even browning.

Remove the aromatics and ensure to push out every last drop of oil back into the saucepan.

Bring the temperature of the oil back to 300F and turn off the heat.

Ladle the hot oil onto the mix in the heat-proof bowl, one ladle at a time to prevent burning and stir in between each ladle.

Once all the oil has been added, add 1 dash of sesame seeds.

Store in a clean container in the fridge.

[- Notes:
-- We used bird's eye chilis and they were very spicy.
-- We added 1/8 tsp of Sichuan peppercorns.
