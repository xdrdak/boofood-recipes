-- Recipe for Black Bean Chili (Pork)

[- Required equipment: Instant Pot -]

Set the #instant pot{} to Saute and wait until the inner pot gets hot.

Add @oil{2%tbsp} (or lard) and grease the inner pot.

Add @ground pork{600%g} and render the fat out, and try to get some browning on the pork.

Once the @ground pork{} has some color, add @jalapeno{1} [- deseeded and chopped -] and @onion{1} [- large sized, chopped -] and saute until the aromas release.

Add @salt{1%tbsp}, @chili powder{2%tbsp}, @cayenne powder{1%tbsp}, @cumin powder{2%tsp}, and @coriander powder{1%tsp}, and saute until fragrant.

Add @bell pepper{2} [- medium sized, chopped -], @garlic{4%cloves} [- minced -], @black beans{1%cup} [- dried, rinsed, or 2 x 15 ounce cans, drained and rinsed -], and @canned tomatoes{1} [- Italian Whole, juices included -] and deglaze the pot. Ensure to release everything that is stuck to the bottom of the pot (this is FLAVOR!!).

Add @water{500%ml} [- with 1 tsp of MSG -] (or chicken broth) until it covers about 3/4 of the mix in the pot.

Set the #instant pot{} to High pressure for ~pressure{25%minutes}, and natural release.

-- Notes:
-- Note that chicken is optional. We tried adding some pumpkin, and it disappeared into the chili.
-- We also realized that ground pork is much superior to chicken in this recipe.
