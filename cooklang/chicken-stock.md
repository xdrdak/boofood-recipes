-- Recipe for Chicken Stock

Put @chicken bones{} (3 whole chickens, meat removed) into the #Instant Pot insert.

Add @water{1%L} (add more if required, just enough to cover the carcass most of the way).

Set #Instant Pot to ~pressure{60%minutes} on High Pressure, quick release.

Can be cooked for 35 minutes, natural release if you want the bones to hold up better.

[- Notes:
-- The broth that comes out of this will be quite thick and rich. Itâ€™s best used in soup noodles, where you dilute the broth with water before serving.
-- Adding 1 star anise will make it smell amazing if making soup noodles.
