-- Recipe for Crepes

In a large bowl, whisk together @flour{1 cup}, @eggs{2}, @milk{1/2 cup}, @water{1/2 cup}, @melted butter{2 tbsp}, @salt{1/4 tsp}, and @sugar{1 tbsp} until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.

Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.

Serve hot.
