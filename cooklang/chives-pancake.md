-- Recipe for Chives Pancake

In a bowl, mix together:
@AP flour{3/4 cups},
@corn starch{1/2 tbsp},
@salt{1 tsp}.

Add @cold water{1 cup} and mix until smooth.

Fold in @chinese chives{2 cups, cut into 1-2 inch sticks}.

Add @chili oil{1 tsp} (optional).

Heat a cast-iron or stainless steel pan over medium heat and add some oil.

Pour the batter into the pan, spreading it thinly.

Cook until the bottom is golden and crispy, then flip and add more oil to crisp up the other side.

Serve hot with chili oil and/or Chinese vinegar.

[- Notes:
-- Texture should resemble a thick pancake batter. Add the water slowly until the desired texture is achieved.
-- Non-stick pans don't work as well for achieving a crispy crust.
