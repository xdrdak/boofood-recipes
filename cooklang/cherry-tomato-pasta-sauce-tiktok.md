-- Recipe for Cherry Tomatoes TikTok Pasta Sauce

[- Required equipment: Oven -]

Preheat the #oven{} to 400F.

Line a baking dish, ideally a sheet pan, with aluminum foil.

In a bowl, mix @cherry tomatoes{1 box}, @garlic{2 cloves, sliced into thin strips}, @thyme{1 sprig dried}, @chili flakes{1 tsp}, and @olive oil{0.5%cups}.

Add a healthy pinch of @salt{} and mix.

Spread the mixture onto the foiled sheet pan.

Bake for 30 minutes.

You'll know when it's done when there's a nice char on the tomatoes and they look like they've been roasted to oblivion.

Put the mixture back into a bowl and crush up all the tomatoes and emulsify the entire mixture.

Season to taste with salt and @pepper{}.
