Ingredients: Flour, Green Onion

# Ingredients

- [ ]  200 g Flour
- [ ]  140 g Water (Cold)
- [ ]  Cooking Oil
- [ ]  2 Bunches of Scallions

# Instructions

1. Combine flour and water
2. Kneed until it is smooth and shiny and does not stick to the touch anymore (Try not to add too much extra flour)
3. Cut the dough in quarters
4. Shape each quarter into balls
5. Cover with a wet towel and let them rest for 20 minutes
6. While the dough rests, cut the scallions (smaller the better)
7. When the dough is ready, take one quarter and roll it out into a large circle of about 0.1-0.2cm in thickness
    1. To do this step, a small bit of flour on the bottom of the work surface will be needed to prevent stickage. If it's hard to keep rolling, it's probably missing some flour so sprinkle some on
8. Sprinkle 2-3 tsp of salt evenly over the dough 
9. Brush/Sprinkle some oil on the top
10. Sprinkle the scallions
11. Roll the dough into a log, twist in opposite ends into a rope 
12. Curl it into two tier circle and squish it down a little bit while trying to not burst the dough
13. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes
14. Roll it out into a 1 cm pancake and try to not burst the dough
15. Heat up some oil on a non stick pan (do not need much oil), and fry the first side
16. After flipping onto the second side, reduce the heat and cover the pan to let the center of the pancake steam 
17. Once both sides are crispy, remove and serve
