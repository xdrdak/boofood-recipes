Ingredients: Butter, Cocoa Powder, Milk, Sugar, Vanilla Extract

# Ingredients

- [ ]  2 cups White Sugar
- [ ]  1/2 cup Cocoa Powder
- [ ]  1 cup Milk
- [ ]  4 tbsp Unsalted Butter
- [ ]  1 tsp Vanilla Extract

# Instructions

1. Grease a 8x8 inch square baking pan. It can be any size really, but make sure that it's greased VERY WELL. Parchment paper and aluminum paper don't work too well with this. You're much better off using a glass or metal baking pan that is greased
2. Combine sugar, cocoa powder, milk in a medium saucepan with high sides. If it looks a little bit too big for the amount of liquids, that's perfect
3. Stir constantly until it boils
4. Once it starts boiling, stop stirring and reduce the heat to a medium and simmer
    1. Note that at this step, expect the mixture to increase in volume (about double?) and come up the sides
5. Place candy thermometer in pan and cook until temperature reaches **238 degrees F**(114 degrees C). If you are not using a thermometer, then cook until a drop of this mixture in a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. 
    1. If you do the drop method multiple times, make sure to use a clean utensil every time, or the sugar will crystalize
6. Remove from heat and reduce the temperature by stirring with a heat proof spatula for 1-2 minutes
7. Add butter and vanilla extract
    1. At this stage, you will want to have a mental capture of the shine of the mixture
8. Beat with a wooden spoon until it loses its sheen (that shiny tint)
9. Pour it into the prepared pan and let it cool
10. Cut into desired shapes

# Notes

It's best to serve these as small bites. Makes very good gifts
