Ingredients: MSG, Rice

# Ingredients (For 1 person)

- [ ]  1/4 rice cups (the little scoop that comes with the rice, DO NOT USE THE USUAL MEASURING CUPS) of White Rice
- [ ]  2 cups Water
- [ ]  1/4 tsp Salt
- [ ]  1/4 tsp Chicken Bouillon Powder
- [ ]  1 Century Egg (optional, obviously)

# Instructions

1. Wash the rice
2. Boil the water with strips of ginger
3. Add the rice into the water and stir it lightly until it comes to a boil again
4. Once it comes to a boil again, do not stir anymore, and cover the pot
5. Cook on medium for 25 minutes
    1. During this time, if you want to add a century egg in later, you can open it up and cut it up at this time
6. Open the lid of the pot, (Optional: add half the century egg) and whisk the mixture until it becomes the consistency you like
    1. At this point, you can add whatever else you would like in your congee. It doesn't have to be century egg, it can be chicken, etc.
7. Add seasoning and put the rest of the century egg in

NOTES

We like to stir fry some egg,shallots, garlic, lap cheong, coriander, green onions
