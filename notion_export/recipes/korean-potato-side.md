# Instructions

1. Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes
2. Cook the potatoes on a heated non stick pan in the oil, until they are 1/2 cooked, approx. 5 minutes
3. Add the water, soy sauce, corn syrup, sugar , garlic
4. Taste it and adjust. *Remember that it will reduce down a lot more*
5. Reduce it into a paste and the potatoes are cooked through

# Notes

Starchy potatoes, like russets will thicken the sauce a lot more than goldens. If it doesn't thicken up like you want, use corn starch 

Can be served hot or cold

Tastes best when it has had time to rest in the fridge overnight
