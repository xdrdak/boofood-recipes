2. Heat the neutral oil in a saucepan until it hits 300F (enough to bubble around a spare piece of onion)
3. Turn the heat lower and add ginger, garlic, shallots, red onions, star anise in that order, slowly one at a time, until all ingredients develop a brown hue
    1. Ensure to stir to prevent burning and for even browning
4. Remove the aromatics and ensure to push out every last drop of oil back into the saucepan
5. Bring the temperature of the oil back to 300F and turn off the heat
6. Ladle the hot oil onto the mix in the heat-proof bowl, one ladle at a time to prevent burning and stir in between each ladle
