# Ingredients

- [ ]  1 ¼ pounds russet potatoes
- [ ]  6 cloves garlic, sliced, or to taste
- [ ]  1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
- [ ]  ½ lemon, juiced
- [ ]  ¼ cup white wine vinegar

- [ ]  1 drizzle olive oil, or to taste
- [ ]  1 pinch minced fresh oregano (optional)

# Instructions

1. Nuke potatoes in the microwave (sensor cook option)
    1. Ensure that there are holes on the skin and that the skin is on the potato (since it will dehydrate)
    2. Usually sensor cook #1 selection
2. While potatoes are cooking, add garlic and 1 teaspoon kosher salt to a mortar and pestle. Crush into a fine paste and reserve.
3. Transfer the potatoes to a mixing bowl. Mash with a potato masher or potato ricer until smooth and lump free. Stir in garlic paste. Add lemon juice and vinegar and stir in with the masher.
4. Whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil in 3 or 4 additions. Add cayenne and more salt if needed. Pass dip through a mesh strainer into a bowl (no need if using ricer). Serve at room temperature, garnished with olive oil and oregano.
