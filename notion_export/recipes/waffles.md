Ingredients: Baking Powder, Eggs, Flour, Milk

# Ingredients (makes 10 waffles in my iron)

- [ ]  1 3/4 cups Flour
- [ ]  1 tsp Baking Powder
- [ ]  1/4 tsp Salt
- [ ]  2 Egg Yolks
- [ ]  1 3/4 cups Milk
- [ ]  1/2 cup Canola Oil (Olive oil works if savory flavor is desired)
- [ ]  2 Egg Whites

# Instructions

1. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt into a medium sized bowl
2. In a smaller bowl, mix egg yolks, milk and oil
3. Combine dry stuff with wet stuff
    1. DO NOT OVERMIX, LUMPS ARE OK!
4. Whisk egg whites until stiff peaks
5. Fold everything together
6. Cook in waffle iron

# Notes

When cooking, brush some maple syrup on the top side once the batter goes in. This makes a small sugar crust

For my waffle iron, it's approx. 9 minutes for the cook time.
