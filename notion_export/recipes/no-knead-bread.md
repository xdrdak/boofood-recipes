Ingredients: Flour, Yeast

# Ingredients

- [ ]  600g Flour (can do 300g of whole wheat and 300g of AP)
- [ ]  9g Salt
- [ ]  6g Instant Yeast
- [ ]  420g Water (warm to the touch) ~105F

# Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, yeast
2. Add water (ensure it is warm to the touch)
3. Cover with plastic wrap and rise for 12-24h at room temp (24h is definitely too much, probably like a 12-16 hours instead)
4. Transfer into fridge and cold rise for another 3-5 days (optional for taste)
5. Turn once or twice and shape into loaf shape, cover and let rise for another 2-4h
6. Preheat oven to 450F with a cast iron Dutch oven inside (add 2 tbsp of water inside the dutch oven for some steam)
7. When the dough is ready, slash the top with a floured knife
8. After the oven has been preheated, wait another 25 mins for the Dutch oven to reach proper temperatures
9. Bake dough inside the Dutch oven for 25 minutes with the lid on
10. Bake another 35mins with the lid off at 400F until the center of the bread registers 209F
11. Remove from the Dutch oven and let rest on a wire rack for 20 mins before slicing and serving

Note

Whole wheat bread tastes better when it's fully cooled
