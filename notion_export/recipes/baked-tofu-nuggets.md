Ingredients: Firm Tofu, Garlic Powder, Miso Paste, Olive Oil

# Ingredients

- [ ]  2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- [ ]  1 Tbsp Corn Starch
- [ ]  1 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- [ ]  1 tbsp miso paste
- [ ]  1 tsp five spice powder (optional)
- [ ]  1/2 tbsp garlic powder
- [ ]  1 block firm tofu
- [ ]  1 handful peanuts (crushed) (optional)

# Instructions

1. Press tofu to bring out as much water as possible
2. Cut tofu into bite sized pieces (1 cut in belly and 3 cut wide and cube-ish)
3. Mix cornstarch and oil
4. Coat the tofu with the oil mixture
5. Bake tofu at 375F for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown
6. Combine soy sauce, miso paste, garlic powder, five spice powder, peanuts
7. Add water until it becomes sauce-like
8. Heat up a pan (maybe a small pot works better if volume isn't enough), and cook the sauce until it's warm
9. Add the nuggets and coat them in sauce, and serve

Note: sunrise brand (texture more soft) not as good as the fontaine sant√© (more like nuggets)

Chouchou likes it when the 5spice powder is replaced with red pork seasoning
