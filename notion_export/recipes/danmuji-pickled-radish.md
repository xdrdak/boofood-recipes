Ingredients: Bay Leaf, Black Peppercorn, Daikon, Garlic, Ground Turmeric, Rice Wine Vinegar, Sugar

# Ingredients

- [ ]  355ml (1 1/2cups) Water
- [ ]  355ml (1 1/2cups) Unseasoned Rice Vinegar
- [ ]  100g (1/2cup) Sugar
- [ ]  15g (1tbsp) Kosher Salt
- [ ]  2 medium clothes garlic, halved lengthwise (or crushed)
- [ ]  1tsp turmeric powder
- [ ]  15 whole black peppercorns (not the same but can use ground black pepper)
- [ ]  2 bay leaves (these don't make too much of a difference)
- [ ]  450g (1 pound) daikon radish sliced into bite sized pieces

# Instructions

1. Stir in all the ingredients except the daikon radish and bring to a boil
2. Remove the mixture from the heat
3. Add the daikon and cover with a lid (leave a medium sized opening to let some of the steam escape)
4. Let cool for 1-2 hours
5. Transfer into clean containers and store in the fridge

# Notes

The pickles will last about 1 month in the fridge or more, depending on how sanitized/airtight the container was

The turmeric will stain like crazy...
