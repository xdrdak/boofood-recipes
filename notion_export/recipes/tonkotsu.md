# Ingredients

## Soup Base

- [ ]  1.5 kg Pork Bones
- [ ]  3-4L Water
- [ ]  1/6 Cabbage
- [ ]  6 cloves Garlic
- [ ]  1/2 Onion

## Tare (quarter this, cause this makes a shit ton)

- [ ]  150 ml Water (37.5ml)
- [ ]  125 ml Japanese All Purpose Soy Sauce (1/2 light 1/2 dark Chinese one would do) (31.25ml)
- [ ]  25 ml Cooking Wine or Sake (6.25ml)
- [ ]  15 ml Mirin (3.75ml)
- [ ]  9g MSG (2.25g)
- [ ]  9g Salt (2.25g)

# Instructions

## Soup Base

1. Soak pork bones overnight in cold water in the fridge
2. Rinse bones
3. Put it on the stove with some fresh water, and heat it up slowly to bring out all the scum
4. Skim off all brown stuff and mix a bit, until no more brown stuff. White scum is ok though
5. Drain into the sink and rinse all the brown stuff off the bones
6. Put it into the pressure cooker and cover with enough water to submerge everything under 1 inch of water, cook on high for 1 hour, and let is natural release
7. Open the lid and put aromatics inside with an extra 1L of water and let it boil for another 1 hour
8. Take an immersion blender and emulsify everything
9. Strain out all of the impurities

## Tare

1. In a small saucepan, put all ingredients except for the MSG and salt
2. Bring to almost boiling (there's some vapor, but no massive bubbles, and it will release some aromas)
3. Add MSG and salt

## Combine

1. Warm up serving bowl in the microwave or with some warm water
2. Cook noodles
3. In the serving bowl, put 300 ml soup base and 20 ml tare and 1 tbsp of lard or aroma oil
4. Put noodles into the bowl, and add toppings
5. Serve hot

# Notes

For the aroma oil, I used scallion ginger oil. You can also use some chili oil to add some spiciness

Topping ideas: wood ear mushroom, bamboo shoots, egg, seaweed, meat, etc.
