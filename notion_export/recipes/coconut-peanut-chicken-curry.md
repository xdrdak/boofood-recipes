# Instructions

1. Toast blanched peanuts 375F, 12 mins, add salt when they're still hot. And cool for a few minutes
2. Blend the peanuts with 1/2 a can of actual coconut milk (leave them chunky)
3. Prepare the chicken overnight (marinade with cooking wine/vinegar, salt and pepper, cornstarch
4. Prepare veggies (onions, carrots, cabbage, potatoes)
5. Oil Dutch oven, undercook the turkey until there is no more red on the outside (we just want to trap the juices)
6. Remove the chicken meat and set aside
7. Deglaze the pan with a bit of veg broth or water and if it doesn't taste burnt, add it into the chicken meat while it rests
8. Add more oil and cook the veggies with some salt and pepper until soft
9. Add peanut paste, and curry powder, stir until fragrant, then add veg broth until the veggies are covered
10. Adjust for peanut/curry/coconut milk ratio (it's ok if it's missing a bit of salt, since it's going into the oven)
11. Bring everything to a boil and add the turkey back in
12. Simmer on medium-low partially covered for 1h or Put everything into the oven 350F partially covered for 30 mins then uncovered for 15 after
13. Adjust for salt/pepper/curry/coconut/peanut flavor

Works great with turkey.
