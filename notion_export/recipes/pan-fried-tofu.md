# Instructions

1. Heat non-stick pan with a bit of oil and wait until the oil has ripples

3. Combine, in a separate bowl, soy sauce, oyster sauce, shaoxing wine, sugar, MSG, water

6. Thicken the sauce with the corn starch slurry 
7. Salt and white pepper to taste
8. Serve with green parts of the green onion on top and over warm rice 

# Notes

Works with soft tofu as well, but Chouchou only likes texture of firm tofu; the firmer the better

Chili oil can replace the Thai chili

Onion works OK as a replacement for the shallot
