# Instructions

1. Combine cabbage, onion, carrots, parsley
2. Sprinkle sugar and salt, toss to combine

5. Combine mayo, vinegar, mustard, black pepper, sugar into a bowl, mix and combine with the vegetable mixture

# Notes

Honestly, I would never buy ingredients specifically for coleslaw, so this recipe is mainly for the ratio.

My most common use case will be to have leftover carrots and cabbage in the fridge, and it will be prepared into a much smaller portion of coleslaw as a sidedish.
