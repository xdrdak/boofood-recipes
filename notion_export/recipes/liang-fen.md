# Notes

Personally, I like it a lot better with the sauce as a paste rather than a soup

Doesn't keep very well, since the water removes itself as it sits in the fridge

Uses for overnight liang fen: Fried, do as you would do fried rice, add 5 spice and taste the sauce, add the liang fen let it heat up until it changes color, and some rice afterwards to absorb the water/sauce
