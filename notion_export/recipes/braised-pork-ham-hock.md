1. Gather all aromatics (spice pouch), wrap everything in a cheesecloth and tie securely with a kitchen string

10. Reduce the heat to low, add brown sugar to the remaining oil

12. Add shaoxing wine (or vinegar), light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water, and bring to a boil
13. Add the ham hock and secure the spice pouch. Ensure the ham hock is fully submerged, otherwise add more water
14. Cover the pot and bring to a boil
15. Cook the ham hock for 3 hours with the lid on, flip it every half hour to ensure it is evenly cooked
16. Once the ham hock falls apart, transfer the ham hock into the serving plate
