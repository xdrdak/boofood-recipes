- [ ]  1 Bell Pepper (chopped into strips)
- [ ]  1 Carrot (chopped into strips)
- [ ]  1 medium sized Onion (red onion ideally) (chopped into strips)

- [ ]  1 handful of Baby Corns (cut in half)
- [ ]  3 cloves of Garlic

Chicken Marinade

- [ ]  1/2 tsp salt
- [ ]  1/2 tsp sugar
- [ ]  1 tsp light soy sauce
- [ ]  1 tsp oyster sauce
- [ ]  1 tsp cooking wine
- [ ]  1/2 tsp MSG

- [ ]  1/2 tsp salt
- [ ]  1 tbsp oyster sauce
- [ ]  2 tbsp water
- [ ]  0.5 tbsp corn starch with 3 tbsp water (corn starch slurry)

# Instructions

1. Chop chicken breast in half lengthwise, then in thin slices perpendicular to the first cut (ensure it is against the grain)
2. Mix in the chicken marinade. Ensure that it is stirred to the point where every piece of chicken is fully covered
3. Let the chicken marinade for about an hour, or until the marinade is fully absorbed. You can speed this process up by stirring fairly vigorously, or using your hands to squish the juices out
4. Once the chicken is ready, take it out to room temperature.
5. Heat up a pan with some oil and cook the chicken until the chicken is about 70-80% cooked (or when most of the chicken has turned white, but not fully cooked)
6. Take out the chicken and let it rest
7. Heat up some more oil into the same pan, and add the garlic, and then add the rest of the vegetables
8. Toss everything together for about 1 minute and then add the vegetable sauce
9. Mix everything to coat all of the vegetables with the sauce
10. Add the chicken back into the pan with 2 tbsp of water
11. Turn up the heat to medium high
12. Cover the pan and let everything steam for 2-3 minutes
    1. After 2-3 minutes, the chicken should be fully cooked
13. Add the final cornstarch slurry and toss everything together, ensuring that the sauce coats every vegetable and chicken piece
