Ingredients: Pork Fat

# Ingredients

- [ ]  Pork fat/skin (or chicken skin)
- [ ]  Salt

# Instructions

1. Cut skin into bite sized pieces (note that it will shrink a lot after cooking)
2. In a saucepan, lay down the pieces, make sure it's not too overcrowded
3. Turn the heat to low (2-3 out of 10)
4. Slap in like 1-2 pinches of salt
5. Slowly wait until it becomes crisp. Stir occasionally so it doesn't burn
6. It will be done once it turns crispy and looks like the picture i sent earlier

# Notes

The pork fat can be stored in the fridge for forever. 

This is just the way we render the fat from leftover pork or chicken (mainly from pork shoulder and turkey), and have grease for forever. Plus, the skin tastes great. 

Please do not buy any skin just to do this.
