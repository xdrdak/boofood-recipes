Ingredients: Baking Powder, Flour, Sugar, Yeast

# Ingredients (makes 8 mantou)

- [ ]  200g AP Flour
- [ ]  45g Water (bowl 1)
- [ ]  45g Water (bowl 2)
- [ ]  20g Sugar
- [ ]  1 tsp (2g) Instant Dry Yeast
- [ ]  1 tsp (2g) Baking Powder

# Instructions

1. Mix sugar with bowl 1 (water)
2. Mix yeast with bowl 2 (water)
3. Sift baking powder with AP flour into stand mixer bowl
4. On lowest stand mixer speed, mix yeast water into dry ingredients
5. Once incorporated, mix in sugar water 
6. Mix together, and if it's still a bit lumpy, add water 1 tbsp at a time. It took us approximately 5 tbsp last time
    1. It should look smooth, but dry
7. Once it looks the way we want, mix on the lowest speed for 8 minutes
8. Cover and rest the dough for 30 minutes
9. Roll the dough thin, fold it in half, then do it again for 6 times in total
10. After step 9, the dough should be in a long flat sheet. 
11. Roll the sheet into a tight log (approx 25 cm long)
12. Gently press down on the dough to create the flat bottom of a mantou
13. With a sharp knife, cut the log into 8 pieces
14. Place each piece on a square sheet of parchment paper, and proof inside of a steamer basket on top of some 28C water for 15 minutes
15. Put the same basket with water on top of the stove and set the flame to medium
16. Once there is steam pluming out of the cracks of the steamer, set a timer for 5 minutes
17. Shut off the heat , and while it is still on top of the hot stove, do not touch for 5 minutes

# Notes

To reheat, just steam it again on high heat this time.
