Ingredients: Cherry Tomato, Garlic, Olive Oil, Thyme

# Ingredients

- [ ]  1 box Cherry Tomatoes (ideally very ripe)
- [ ]  1 sprig dried Thyme
- [ ]  1 tsp chili flakes
- [ ]  1/2 cup Olive Oil (enough to fully cover all the tomatoes and then some)
- [ ]  2 cloves Garlic (sliced into thin strips)
- [ ]  Salt and Pepper to taste

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F
2. Line a baking dish, ideally a sheet pan, with aluminum foil
3. In a bowl, mix the tomatoes, garlic thyme, chili flakes, and olive oil.
4. Add a healthy pinch of salt and mix
5. Spread the mixture onto the foiled sheet pan
6. Bake for 30 minutes
    1. You'll know when it's done when there's a nice char on the tomatoes and they look like they've been roasted to oblivion
7. Put the mixture back into a bowl and crush up all the tomatoes and emulsify the entire mixture
8. Season to taste with salt and pepper

# Notes

This recipe is heavily inspired by the TikTok baked feta pasta craze.
