Ingredients: Chicken, Corn Starch, Eggs, Garlic, Green Onion, Panko, Sesame Oil, White Pepper

# Ingredients

- [ ]  1.5 pounds chicken (ground) (thighs ideally)
- [ ]  1/2 cup panko
- [ ]  1/4 cup green onions (finely chopped) (or yellow onions)
- [ ]  1 whole egg (large) (lightly beaten)
- [ ]  2 cloves garlic
- [ ]  1 tsp sesame oil (ensure it is toasted sesame oil)
- [ ]  1 tsp white pepper (ground)
- [ ]  2 Tbsp corn starch

# Instructions

1. Ground (or finely chop) the chicken
2. Marinade the chicken with all the ingredients for 2 hours+ (overnight at best) and obviously a hefty amount of salt (2 big pinches)
3. Shape the meat into balls
4. Cook the meatballs on a lightly oiled skillet with the lid on until it's fully cooked
5. Served best with a sweet and salty type sauce (ideally teriyaki sauce)

# Notes

Works great with turkey too! Hoisin sauce or hot sauce works great as a sauce!
