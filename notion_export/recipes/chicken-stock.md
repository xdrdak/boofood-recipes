Ingredients: Chicken Bones
Number of Portions: 6

# Ingredients

- [ ]  3 whole chickens (meat removed and reserved for later, only the bones)
- [ ]  1 L water (add more if required, just enough to cover the carcass most of the way)
- [ ]  Salt to taste

# Instructions

1. Put the carcass into the Instant Pot insert
2. Add water until the carcasses are mostly covered
3. Set Instant Pot to high pressure, 60 minutes, quick release 
    1. Can be put for 35 minutes, natural release, if you want the bones to hold up better

# Notes

The broth that comes out of this will be quite thick and rich. Itâ€™s best used in soup noodles, where you dilute the broth with water before serving.

Also, if making soup noodles, adding 1 star anise will make it smell amazing.
