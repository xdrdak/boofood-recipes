Ingredients: Flour, Olive Oil, Sugar, Yeast, Yogurt, Zaatar

# Ingredients

## Dough (makes 6)

- [ ]  310g bread flour (I did AP flour and it seemed OK)
- [ ]  4g salt
- [ ]  2g yeast
- [ ]  6g sugar
- [ ]  4 Tbsp olive oil (50g)
- [ ]  185g yogurt 3%, sub with milk if reallllly in a pinch (warm to the touch)

## Toppings

- [ ]  Zaatar + olive oil + A LITTLE lemon juice (the texture should be an oily slop, a bit more oily than sand)
- [ ]  Add some cheese bits on it!
- [ ]  Going to try a muhammara spread next time!

# Instructions

1. Mix all the dough ingredients together in a stand mixer on medium-high speed for 5 minutes
2. Let rest for 2H in a warm place (above the dish washer if it’s running) - double in size
3. Divide into 6 roughly equal pieces, and shape into little balls
4. Let rest for another 1-2H - double in size
5. Flatten it out and put it directly on a baking sheet
6. Spread the dough out thinly, and add toppings
7. Bake on 375F for ~7minutes
    1. Try 350F for 10 minutes next time

# Notes

It’s actually a lot more pliable after letting it rest for a bit

We need to get that olive spread from amool!!! 

Try to throw in a bit of butter in the dough
