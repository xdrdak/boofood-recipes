Ingredients: Chinese Chives, Corn Starch, Flour

# Ingredients

- [ ]  3/4 cup AP Flour
- [ ]  1/2 Tbsp Corn Starch
- [ ]  1 tsp Salt
- [ ]  1 cup Cold Water
- [ ]  2 cups Chinese chives (cut into 1-2 inch sticks)
- [ ]  1 tsp Chili Oil (optional)

# Instructions

1. Mix everything
    1. Make sure that all the chives are coated with batter!
    2. Texture should be similar to thick pancake batter, but not too critical
        1. Final texture will end up a bit cakey with crisp bits at the ends
2. Shallow fry on a cast-iron or stainless pain
    1. Note that a non-stick doesnâ€™t really work as well, we want that crust
    2. Before flipping, make sure to add oil to have the top-side crispy too
3. Serve with chili oil and/or Chinese vinegar
    1. Booboo likes the sweet vinegar

# Notes

Note that it should resemble a thick pancake batter, add the water slowly until the texture is achieved
