Ingredients: Butter, Eggs, Flour, Ground Beef, Onion, Panko, Potato

# Ingredients

- [ ]  2 Ib Russet Potatoes (for the starch content)
- [ ]  1 Onion (diced)
- [ ]  3 Tbsp Cooking Oil
- [ ]  1 Ib Beef (ground) or Pork
- [ ]  Black pepper
- [ ]  1/4 tsp Kosher Salt (for beef)
- [ ]  2 1/2 cup Panko
- [ ]  1/2 tsp Kosher Salt (for potatoes)
- [ ]  1 tbsp Unsalted Butter
- [ ]  3 Large Eggs
- [ ]  1/2 AP Flour
- [ ]  Tonkatsu Sauce

# Instructions

1. Cook potatoes and mash
2. On an oiled skillet, sweat onions and cook beef
3. Salt and pepper the beef
4. While everything is still warm, mix everything together, and form balls
5. Cover with flour, egg, panko for the crust
6. Bake at 400F for 10 minutes

# Notes

Tried with leftover mashed potatoes, flavor is good, but did not hold up, because of too much water in the potatoes. Could just bake without crust next time for baked goods.

To save for later, you can freeze croquettes up to 1 month. To reheat, put frozen or half defrosted croquettes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350 ºF (180 ºC) for 15 minutes or until the inside is warm.
