# Instructions

1. Mix all batter ingredients together

3. Heat nonstick skillet on medium (4 on our stove), add a bit of oil on the bottom and stack the mixture into the skillet
    1. The pan should NOT be hot enough to have a sizzle sound
4. Use the spatula to shape it into a circle, 1-1.5 inch in height
5. Put a lid on the pan and let it cook for about 10 minutes
6. Use the lid of the pan to flip the okonomiyaki, and cook another 10 minutes with the lid on
7. When the okonomiyaki is done, all the cabbage should have softened. Youâ€™re looking to have no more raw cabbage taste
8. Slather the finished okonomiyaki with kewpie mayo, okonomiyaki sauce, and bonito flakes
